Which CSS library should we use, if we choose to use one?
Summary: In order to quickly make an appealing design for our frontend, we decided to use Bootstrap.
Problem: We need our webapp to look appealing to increase student engagement with the app.
Constraints: No constraints with the CSS libraries because they are usually accessed by url or as a file in the project, and linux/mac/windows can all accomplish this. No constraints in terms of cost either as the best and most popular CSS libraries are open source.
Options:
Bootstrap
Pros: All team members have used bootstrap. Open source. Lots of documentation. Looks pretty good. Fast and quick to start using.
Cons: Makes the website look the same as other bootstrap websites.
Material design
Pros: Looks good. Open source for many components. Lots of documentation.
Cons: Clever design over usability, team members not very familiar.
Rationale: We chose bootstrap because we are 1: most familiar with it. 2: It is very quick to import and start using. 3: It looks good.
